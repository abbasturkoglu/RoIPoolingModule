# RoI Pooling Module

This repo implements the **RoI Pooling**, **RoI Align** & **Precise RoI Pooling**.

RoI Pooling & RoI Align are implemented by myself, only for study reference, while Precise RoI Pooling is original, proposed in the paper [*Acquisition of Localization Confidence for Accurate Object Detection*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11590), published at ECCV 2018 (Oral Presentation), about its usage, u can get a closer look at [*PreciseRoIPooling*](https://github.com/vacancy/PreciseRoIPooling)
